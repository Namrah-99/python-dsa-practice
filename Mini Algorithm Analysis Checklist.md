# ✅ Mini Algorithm Analysis Checklist

1. **What is the input size (n)?**  
   How does the algorithm behave as n grows?

2. **How many operations per element?**  
   - Comparisons?  
   - Swaps?  
   - Arithmetic steps?  
   *(Just estimate the trend, not exact counts.)*

3. **Best, Average, Worst-Case behavior?**  
   Does input order change performance?

4. **What data structures are used?**  
   - Array, list, hash table, tree, etc.  
   - Do they match the operations being performed?

5. **Time Complexity**  
   Does it grow like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n²), etc.?

6. **Space Complexity**  
   - Extra arrays?  
   - Temporary buffers?  
   - Recursion stack?  
   - Is it in-place?

7. **Are there loops inside loops?**  
   - Single loop → O(n)  
   - Nested loop → O(n²)  
   - Divide-and-conquer → often O(n log n)

8. **Any early stopping opportunities?**  
   Can you break early when the answer is found?

9. **Any redundant computation?**  
   Are you repeating work that could be cached or precomputed?

10. **Can you choose a better data structure or algorithm?**  
    - Hash table for O(1) lookups  
    - Binary search for sorted data  
    - Heap for priority selection  
    - Dynamic programming instead of repeated recursion
