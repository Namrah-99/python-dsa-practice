# Mental Dry Run Tips

- Track array at each pass → use small arrays for practice.
- Count operations → comparisons, swaps, shifts.
- Highlight sorted section → the last element in each pass is guaranteed in place.
- Use index markers → mark i and j to visualize loops.
- Visual memory tricks: Think of "bubbles rising" to remember what swaps happen.

# Key Metrics to Analyze in Interviews
- Number of comparisons and swaps
- Best, worst, and average case time complexities
- Space complexity
- Stability and Adaptiveness
- Number of passes
- Possible optimizations

If you can visualize the array after each pass mentally, count comparisons and swaps, and explain best/worst cases clearly, you will impress interviewers.

# Factors to Consider When Analyzing Sorting Algorithms

Time Complexity
- Best, Worst, Average cases
- Number of comparisons, swaps, or shifts

Space Complexity
- In-place or requires extra memory (arrays, recursion stack, auxiliary arrays)

Stability
- Does the algorithm preserve the order of equal elements?

Adaptiveness
- Does it take advantage of already partially sorted data?

Implementation Complexity
- How easy is it to implement and maintain?

Other Metrics
- Cache efficiency (memory access patterns)
- Parallelizability (can it run in parallel?)
- Overhead of recursion or function calls (for recursive sorts)
